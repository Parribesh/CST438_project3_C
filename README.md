# CST438_project3_C
README.md
By the end of the first week of the project I want each git repo to have a README.md file that answers the following questions:
Title of the project
Riddlr
Goal of the project
Provide users with the ability to solve, rate and discuss riddles.
Who is on the team
Francisco Hernandez (fjhernan)

The minimum viable product
An app for solving, rating, and discussing riddles. The app will have user profiles, riddles, and the ability to solve, save, and search for riddles.
This should tie in with the goal. If the goal is to offer social media for cats (Clowder Connector), than it would be something like 'create a profile and share stories'
I want a timeline for completion with goals
These goals should relate to the user stories that you have on your project board
The timeline should be updated as the project progresses
Mockups and ERDs from the proposal
These may need to be improved from the proposal
I also want these to be kept CURRENT that means if the database structure changes, the ERDs will need to change.
A list of technologies and links to them
We are using Android so a link to that is a bare minimum
Include any and all APIs you are using
